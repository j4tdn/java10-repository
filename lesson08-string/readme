1.String Immutable
===> Cannot change the value of original string memory in heap
String Object         >> heap
String literal >>> winner>> constant pool

2. String Mutable
StringBuilder ==> Single thread >> heap
StringBuffer ==> Multiple thread >> heap

Speed: StringBuilder >> StringBuffer >> String Literal
